Worked on this project for a while  but was hestitant on posting it here as I believed there was still so much more to do with the data but I believe corona virus was a disease that opened the door to thinking differently for many people
One thing for me working on this dataset I wanted to really see what the data will show me on the number of lifes that were lost and in what countries.
and in the countries lifes were lost how was the vaccine final distributed when it was  available were these countries with the most deaths priortised?
I got my data from our world in data website below:
